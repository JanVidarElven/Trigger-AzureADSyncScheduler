This repository is for Azure Resource Manager and creating an Azure Automation Runbook, as demoed on my blog at http://systemcenterpoint.wordpress.com.

This sample shows how you can deploy a runbook, a credential and variable asset the runbook relies on, through an Azure Resource Manager template. 

It also contains a sample script, Deploy-AzureResourceGroup, that you can use to get you started with the deployment from PowerShell.
